# FB-Feeder

This extension redirects facebook.com to the facebook.com/?filter=all&sk=h_chr to take you straight to your feed page.  This skips the home page which is full of the suggested pages.  If you still want to visit the home page (www.facebook.com), click the Home button at the top of any Facebook Page.

To install:
1)  Go to chrome://extensions
2)  Turn on developer mode in the top right.
3)  Click "Load unpacked" in the top left.
4)  Select the directory with the extension in it.
5)  Enjoy skipping all of the suggestions on Facebook!
